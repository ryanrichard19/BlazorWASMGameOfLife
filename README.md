# Blazor Game of Life

Description:

A simple Conway's Game of Life implementation using Blazor WebAssembly and .NET 7. This project demonstrates how to create a responsive, interactive simulation of the popular cellular automaton within a Blazor WebAssembly app. The user can start and stop the simulation using on-screen controls, and the application efficiently updates the game grid using SVG elements.

Features:

Blazor WebAssembly application built with .NET 7
SVG-based game grid rendering for efficient updates
Responsive design that works on various screen sizes
Start and stop controls for the simulation
Customizable simulation parameters such as grid size, cell size, and update interval
How to run:

Clone the repository.
Open a terminal/command prompt, navigate to the project folder, and run dotnet restore to restore the necessary packages.
Run dotnet run or dotnet watch run to build and launch the application.
Open a web browser and navigate to https://localhost:5001/gameoflife to view and interact with the Game of Life simulation.
Feel free to contribute to the project, report issues, or suggest improvements!
